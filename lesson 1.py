### COMMENTS ###

# these are just lessons I think are useful and that maybe go a little more indepth on what programming actually is
# a really nice overall tutorial can be found here https://www.w3schools.com/PYTHON/default.asp

# Firstly what you are seeing here is a comment. Comments are used to describe what your code is doing. These lines are ignored by the computer when your program is run
# Comments in python start with a #, you'll need one for each line

# Your computer reads just like you do. Left to right top to bottom. 

# lang > math

### VARIABLES ###

# naming conventions in python
# variables cannot start with a number or symbol
# variables cannot contain a space
# 9trees = 9 is not valid
# but trees9 = 9 is ok!
# commonly in python you'll see either camelCase where every other word after the first word is capitalized 
# or snake_case which is all lower case with underscores where a space would be

my_number = 5
myVariable = "Hello World!"
#print
print(myVariable)
print(5)

# adjusting variables
my_number = my_number + 1
myVariable = 7
print(my_number)
print(myVariable)
